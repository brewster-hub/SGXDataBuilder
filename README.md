# SGXDBuilder

This tool allows building SGX audio file banks used in various PSP and PS3 games (sgd/sgh/sgb) from standard audio formats.

This is a format and PSP/PS3 Sound Library privately created by Sony/SCE and used in games published by them (listed below) for PSP and PS3 Games.
It has been superseded by:
* `SXD` - PSV-PS4 (Gran Turismo Sport, Gravity Rush, Freedom Wars, Soul Sacrifice)
* `SZD` - PS4-PS5 (Gran Turismo 7, Astro's Playroom)

## Unsupported features
* Sequenced Chunks/Files (SEQD)
* Notes (RGND, MIDI/Note playback)
* Literally anything else, it is a complex format designed to fine tune audio playback

## Supported Input formats:
* PS-ADPCM [PS3/PSP] - `.vag`
* AC3 [PS3] - `.ac3`
